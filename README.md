# Rock-Paper-Scissors game in JS

## Game Requirements
Rock–paper–scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of         three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a       fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two             possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.

In this game, you can play with the computer as an opponent. You can also see the result and the cumulative scores. 

## Technology Stack
This a web-based application. This means the user would need to access this from a browser. The application consists of a user interface built with HTML with Taiwind CSS library used for styling. The logic is written using vanilla Javascript with no additional libraries.

There are some acceptance tests (also known as end-to-end testing) done while building this application.
